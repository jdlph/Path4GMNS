    "### A Little Bit of History\n",
    "\n",
    "During the early development of Path4GMNS, demand.csv is presumed to be given and zone information is provided along node.csv. The latter is the current design of GMNS and is endorsed in [OSM2GMNS](https://github.com/jiawlu/OSM2GMNS). This assumption leads to the following legacy way (as the original design of Path4GMNS) to load demand and zone information while the new way demonstrated was in **Section 3.2**. \n",

    "\n",
    "The demand file is specified in settings.yml as demand.csv. You can change it to any demand file in your PWD. This design actually allows us to load multiple demand files simultaneously corresponding to different period and agent_type. We will elaborate it in a future release.\n",

    "If you came to Path4GMNS before v0.8.6, you probably notice that \"load_demand=True\" was not required as demand will be loaded by default. This is one of the changes introduced in v0.8.6 to better promote the new way of loading demand. The legacy way are still used in [demo.py](https://github.com/jdlph/Path4GMNS/blob/dev/tests/demo.py) and the code examples in [User Manual](https://github.com/jdlph/Path4GMNS/tree/dev#user-manual), which will be updated gradually over time. You can still use this legacy way with the [existing sample data sets](https://github.com/jdlph/Path4GMNS/tree/dev/data), which do not have zone.csv but have zone information in node.csv. \n",
