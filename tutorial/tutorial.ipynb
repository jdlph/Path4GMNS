    "If the original capacity of an affected link i is C, its capacity then will be r * C with a reduction ratio of r when a special event is present.

When the time-dependent accessibility is of interested, time-dependent link travel time (i.e., VDF_fftt from a given demand period in link.csv) will come into play by overwriting the (static) link free-flow speed (from either link.csv or settings.yml. both are denoted as \"free_speed\")."
