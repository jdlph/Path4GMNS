    WARNING
    -------
    MAKE SURE TO BACKUP agent.csv and link_performance.csv if you have
    called perform_network_assignment() before. Otherwise, they will be
    overwritten by results generated by DTALite.

    Parameters
    ----------
    assignment_mode
        0: Link-based UE, only generates link performance file without agent
           path file
        1: Path-based UE, generates link performance file and agent path file
        2: UE + dynamic traffic assignment (DTA), generates link performance file and agent path file
        3: ODME
    
    iter_num
        number of assignment iterations to be performed before optimizing
        column pool
    
    column_update_iter
        number of iterations to be performed on optimizing column pool

    Outputs
    -------
    Depending on the selected assignment_mode, one or two of the following
    files will be generated.

    1. agent.csv: paths/columns
    2. link_performance.csv: assigned volumes and other link attributes on each
       link

    Link-based UE, link_performance.csv
    Path-based UE, agent.csv and link_performance.csv
    UE + DTA, agent.csv and link_performance.csv
    ODME
